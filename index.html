          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>The const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value. </li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
          <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop.</li>
          <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array,</li>
          li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1.</li>
